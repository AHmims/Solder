<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As of writing this, the project doesn't have a clear roadmap onto what this could possibly grow up to be, we have
ideas and speculations but nothing guaranteed yet.

What's available now is a scrapping script that takes an input information like what page to scrap and how periodically 
do so and expect the results to show up _(hopefully)_.

Here's what to come when it comes to the script:
* A seamless experience by providing some kind of interface that enables the normal user to interact with this
* Have notifications support to warn the user when a said action is triggered

The bigger goal;
* A 90s metaverse
