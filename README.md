<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The project doesn't have a clear roadmap onto what it could possibly grow up to be as of yet, we have
ideas and speculations but nothing guaranteed.

For the time being, it provides a web scraper that takes a .json file containing _module data, scraping interval, & product pages_
as input and spews out the requested information on a defined time interval _(hopefully)_.

Current plans for the project:
* A seamless experience by providing some kind of interface that enables the normal user to interact with this
* Have notifications support to warn the user when a said action is triggered.

The bigger goal:
* A 90s metaverse.
